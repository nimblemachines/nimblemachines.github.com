<div id="content">
<p>In his landmark 1973 book <a href="/tools-for-conviviality-book/"><em>Tools for conviviality</em></a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_Illich">Ivan Illich</a> mounted a compelling critique of industrial society. He claimed that we cannot have a society of authentic human relations unless the tools for production of the artifacts needed by that society are <em>under the control of the people using them</em>. Here is a quote to whet your appetite:</p>
<blockquote><p>I choose the term &ldquo;conviviality&rdquo; to designate the opposite of industrial productivity. I intend it to mean autonomous and creative intercourse among persons, and the intercourse of persons with their environment; and this in contrast with the conditioned response of persons to the demands made upon them by others, and by a man-made environment. I consider conviviality to be individual freedom realized in personal interdependence and, as such, an intrinsic ethical value. I believe that, in any society, as conviviality is reduced below a certain level, no amount of industrial productivity can effectively satisfy the needs it creates among society&rsquo;s members.</p></blockquote>
<p>This fits nicely with what I (when I remember to!) consider part of the &ldquo;mission&rdquo; of Nimble Machines: <em>liberation</em>. Not necessarily, or simply, liberation <em>from</em> technology, but perhaps liberation through <em>convivial</em> technology. As much as I might like to be, I am not a Luddite; technology fascinates me. But I cannot stomach technologies whose production <em>or consumption</em> is inimical to personal freedom, expression, and relatedness.</p>
