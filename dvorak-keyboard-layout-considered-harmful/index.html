<p>In the 1930s, August Dvorak studied typewriting behavior and wrote a long book about it, called, amazingly, <em>Typewriting behavior</em>.</p>
<p>The currently widely used keyboard layout &ndash; commonly called &ldquo;qwerty&rdquo;, and now internationalized with minor variations &ndash; was designed haphazardly; there is even evidence that its design deliberately slows typists down. Dvorak concluded that qwerty was very inefficient, and designed several rational and efficient layouts: one for two hands, and one each for the left and right hands alone. (Try <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22dvorak+keyboard+layout%22">Google</a> for details.)</p>
<p>I learned to type, on a qwerty keyboard, in the sixth grade. Nothwithstanding my years of qwerty muscle memory, I was intrigued by this &ldquo;new&rdquo; layout (now seventy-odd years old and mostly unheard-of and unused), and decided to give it a try. This was mostly out of my (somewhat obsessive) interest in trying to find and use the Right Thing, the perfect tool for the job.</p>
<p>A lot of people believe that using a Dvorak layout eases strain on the hands, and helps to prevent, or ease the symptoms of, typing-induced repetitive stress injury (RSI).</p>
<p>I had never experienced any numbness or soreness in my hands, or any other signs of RSI, even though I have used qwerty keyboards &ndash; both typewriter and computer &ndash; quite heavily in my twenty-some-odd years of typing... until I tried Dvorak. I have been using the layout for about three years now, and have experienced occasional trouble, especially with my right hand. I find this very odd, as it contradicts everyone else&rsquo;s experience and belief.</p>
<p>It may have something to do with my heavy use of certain Unix commands &ndash; like &ldquo;ls -l&rdquo; &ndash; that on the Dvorak layout are typed entirely with the pinky of the right hand. I haven&rsquo;t yet done so, but I&rsquo;d like to conduct an experiment: remapping that command to a more comfortable place on the keyboard.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also considering switching back to qwerty &ndash; I don&rsquo;t think it would be that hard &ndash; partly because of my RSI experience, but also because I used to have a beautiful Olympia manual typewriter, made in Germany in the 1950s, that I miss dearly. There aren&rsquo;t many (any?) typewriters that use the Dvorak layout.</p>
<p>I <em>like</em> typewriters.</p>
