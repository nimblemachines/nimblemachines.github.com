<h1>A great interview with Alan Kay</h1>

<p>There is an amazing <a href="https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=1039523">interview with Alan Kay</a> in ACM Queue (from 2004). He talks about computer architecture, languages, performance, and what was going on at Xerox PARC (the Palo Alto Research Center) in the 1970s and 80s. It&rsquo;s a wide-ranging and interesting interview, and worth reading.</p>
<p>My favorite quote from the interview:</p>
<blockquote><p>One of my favorite old languages is one called Lucid by Ed Ashcroft. It was a beautiful idea. He said, &ldquo;Hey, look, we can regard a variable as a stream, as some sort of ordered thing of its values and time, and use Christopher Strachey&rsquo;s idea that everything is wonderful about tail recursion and Lisp, except what it looks like.&rdquo; When he looked at Lisp, he had a great insight: which was that tail-recursive loops and Lisp are so clean because you&rsquo;re generating the right-hand side of all the assignment statements before you do any rebinding. So you&rsquo;re automatically forced to use only old values. You cannot rebind, so there are no race conditions on anything.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>You just write down all of those things, and then when you do the tail recursion, you rebind all of those variables with these new values. Strachey said, &ldquo;I can write that down like a sequential program, as a bunch of simultaneous assignment statements, and a loop that makes it easier to think of.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s basically what Lucid did &ndash; there is no reason that you have to think recursively for things that are basically iteration, and you can make these iterations as clean as a functional language if you have a better theory about what values are.</p></blockquote>
<p>When I learned about this idea (from the Structure and interpretation of computer programs) it seemed like a deep way to think about &ndash; and do! &ndash; iteration.</p>
<p>What I didn&rsquo;t get from this interview is what Alan means when he talks about some &ldquo;new generation&rdquo; of languages that he hoped would succeed Smalltalk and Lisp, but because Smalltalk and Lisp were so <em>great</em>, people stopped innovating at that point, and the education of programmers lagged behind the wonderful technology available (even truer today!!), so that it became a pop culture of Basic, Pascal, then C, and now Java and Python/Perl/Ruby.</p>
<p>I disagree that the innovation stopped; it went <em>back</em> into research labs and research universities, hidden away from the popular gaze. The new languages that Alan hoped for are <em>precisely</em> the functional languages that he seems to like. He doesn&rsquo;t say they are the next big thing, though; I <em>do</em> think they are.</p>
