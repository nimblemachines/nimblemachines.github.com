<p>After &ldquo;looking in on it&rdquo; several times over the last few years, I have finally taken the plunge and really dug into the <a href="/lua-programming-language/">Lua programming language</a>, and I love it. I&rsquo;m having the same feelings about Lua that I had about <a href="/forth-is-a-convivial-tool/">Forth</a>. Is there a similar explanation? I think there is.</p>
<p>Lua is small &ndash; its implementation is about 16000 lines of C code &ndash; very modest for a &ldquo;modern&rdquo; program. This is about six times the size of my <a href="https://muforth.nimblemachines.com/">muforth</a> project &ndash; the smallest Forth I was able to write in C.</p>
<p>Lua, like Forth, has a few deep ideas that, once mastered, open infinite possibilities. Like Forth, it was designed to be <em>extensible</em>. Lua is well-documented, well-written, and has a simple C API, so it can be easily &ldquo;glued&rdquo; to other programs.</p>
<p>Lua is, by design and intention, a malleable tool, of such modest scope that it is possible for someone, investing a few weeks of study, to learn the system so thoroughly as to &ldquo;call it their own&rdquo;. At this point Lua too becomes a <em><a href="/convivial-tool/">convivial tool</a></em>.</p>
