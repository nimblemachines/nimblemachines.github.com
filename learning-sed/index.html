<p>Today (2006 January 04 20:57) I finished a small <em>sed</em> project: converting the 5000-line body of an html page to a form that was much more useful (to me). It was a good excuse to put <em>sed</em> through its paces, and to finally learn about its hidden nooks and crannies. The main feature I missed: the ability to set variables and to copy their values into RHSs of <em>s</em> (substitution) commands. As it was, I got to practice my Forth programming: moving strings between the pattern (stack) and hold (return stack) spaces. ;-)</p>
<p>Unfortunately the FreeBSD man page is an awful tutorial (and a mediocre reference). After getting quite frustrated with it I searched and found some more useful sources. The <a href="http://www.faqs.org/faqs/editor-faq/sed/index.html">FAQ</a> was a good start. But the gold mine I found <a href="http://sed.sourceforge.net/grabbag/tutorials/sed_mcmahon.txt">here</a>: the original manual that the original <em>sed</em> author &ndash; Lee McMahon &ndash; wrote for the original version. (Here is the <a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/7thEdMan/vol2/sed">original troff source</a>.)</p>
<p>As is often the case, the first telling of the story is clearer, crisper, and gentler than all its successors.</p>
<p>I have edited out the page headers and footers (which were printed inline), and have removed (and added) a few blank lines, for clarity.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, please give a warm welcome to...</p>

               SED -- A Non-interactive Text Editor

                             ABSTRACT
 
           Sed  is a non-interactive context editor that runs
      on the UNIX operating system.  Sed is  designed  to  be
      especially useful in three cases:
 
           1)  To edit files too large for comfortable inter-
                active editing;
           2) To edit any size  file  when  the  sequence  of
                editing  commands  is  too  complicated to be
                comfortably typed in interactive mode.
           3) To perform multiple `global' editing  functions
                efficiently in one pass through the input.

<p>It&rsquo;s amazing what you can do with just the basic tools: ed, sed, lex, yacc, awk, cat, dd, rm, ls, mv, sh, cp, &amp; grep.</p>

<p>Why was it necessary to use <em>sed</em>? Personally, I find <em>awk</em> more <em>user friendly</em> &ndash; and it works for most of the things I need. And I can remember all (well, most) of its builtins. --Michael Pruemm</p>
</div>

<p>The way I had to tear apart and rebuild the text seemed much harder in awk. I wasn&rsquo;t breaking things up by spaces; instead I relied entirely on REs, and I didn&rsquo;t see a clean way to do this in awk. I didn&rsquo;t want to use <em>substr</em> and friends: REs were a much better match.</p>
<p>Am I mistaken here?</p>
<div class="voice3">
<p>Awk has <em>match</em>, <em>sub</em> and <em>gsub</em> functions that take regular expressions. Also, <em>split</em> and the field and record separators can be regular expressions. So I would say, yes, you can do all that in awk and it is probably more readable.</p>
<p>Note that this applies to what is sometimes called <em>new awk</em> as described in the book <em><a href="http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/awkbook/">The AWK Programming language</a></em> by Aho, Weinberger and Kernighan. Some (older) systems have <em>awk</em> and <em>nawk</em> executables where the latter supports the new features described in the book. The programs <em>gawk</em> and <em>mawk</em> always did, as does the version that is available from the book page, <em>the one true awk</em>.</p>
<p>A small example of what you wanted to do might be helpful for further discussion.</p>

<p>Well, I had an HTML file full of references (inside a table) of the form:</p>
<pre>
 &lt;td width="60">1/4/05&lt;/td>
 &lt;td width="120">This is a title&lt;/td>
 &lt;td width="480">This is a long description, probably several lines long,  
     describing the object&lt;/td>
</pre>
<p>There were several hundred of these triples, and a bunch of other junk. The first thing I did was to throw away everything that didn&rsquo;t match one of the three lines. Then I canonicalized the date formats &ndash; they needed to be mm/dd/yyyy so I could later generate link names of the form <em>yyyymmdd-special</em>.</p>
<p>Then, for each triple I generated (roughly, given the above &ldquo;example&rdquo;):</p>
<pre>
 &lt;h2>&lt;em>2005.01.04&lt;/em>.
 &lt;a href="http://example.com/20050104-special">This is a title&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
 &lt;p>This is a long ... object&lt;/p>
</pre>
<p>Not complicated, mind, and quite easy to do in <em>sed</em>, but only <em>once I had concatenated the three things into one long line</em> (using <em>h</em> and <em>H</em>) so I could match all three parts in one long RE to build the final HTML.</p>
