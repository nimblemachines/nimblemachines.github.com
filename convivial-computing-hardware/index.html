<p>No technological artifact &ndash; hardware or software &ndash; can be considered a <a href="/convivial-tool/">convivial tool</a> if it is opaque, ill-documented, or overly complex. For a tool to be convivial I have to be able to make it <em>mine</em> &ndash; which means potentially putting it to uses the designer didn&rsquo;t expect or intend. (These are probably the most creative uses of the hardware, by the way.)</p>
<p>Convivial hardware has to be:</p>
<ul>
<li>simple enough to understand deeply after modest study;</li>
<li>transparent &ndash; I can get to the bits, down to &ldquo;bare metal&rdquo;;</li>
<li>well-documented &ndash; if I don&rsquo;t know how it works, I can&rsquo;t use it for <em>my</em> purposes.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Mac is <em>not</em> convivial: there is too much smoke, too much (undocumented) black magic, and too many layers of software between you and the bare metal.</p>
<p>The PC is <em>potentially</em> convivial: most of the parts are documented, but it&rsquo;s still way too complex for an individual to understand. And the bare metal can be buggy in painful and undocumented ways!</p>
<p>Microcontrollers &ndash; especially of the 8-bit variety &ndash; <em>are</em> convivial: they are small and simple; you program them down to the bare metal; they can be &ldquo;misused&rdquo; creatively.</p>
