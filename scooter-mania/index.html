<p>Some time in 2004 or 2005 I decided I just <em>had</em> to have a scooter.</p>
<p>After doing some research I decided that the scooter for me was the Bajaj Chetak. Here are a couple of pictures: <img src="/-/bajaj-chetak-1.jpg" alt="Bajaj Chetak" title="Bajaj Chetak" /> <img src="/-/bajaj-chetak-2.jpg" alt="Bajaj Chetak" title="Bajaj Chetak" /></p>
<p>It is very old-skool. All-metal frame (new scoots are mostly plastic), 4 speed manual transmission (again, almost all new scoots are automatic), spare tire, lots of storage space. In the 70s Bajaj made Vespas under license from Piaggio, so it&rsquo;s no surprise that their scooters are very Vespa-like.</p>
<p>I was all set to buy a Chetak until I read a review. It had old-world charm (dim headlamp), loads of character (quirky handlebar controls), and lousy brakes. Hmmm. And they&rsquo;re relatively expensive: in the US MSRP is supposed to be $2699, but everyone seems to want to sell them for $3000 or more.</p>
<p>I started to look elsewhere; that&rsquo;s when I rekindled an old love affair: the <a href="/dual-sport-motorcycle/">dual sport motorcycle</a>.</p>

<p>Some time after this page was written, Bajaj stopped making scooters. Somehow, even in India, the scooter market dried up. People there want small motorcycles instead.</p>
<p>I suppose I was feeling the same way, when I wrote, above, that I started to look elsewhere, and rekindled my own love affair with small(ish) motorcycles &ndash; dual sport bikes in particular.</p>
<p>But even a 650cc bike is big enough that it gets dubious gas mileage &ndash; maybe 45 to 50 MPG. I think this is ridiculous, that something so much smaller and lighter than a car, with an engine one-third the size of that of a subcompact car, gets barely better mileage than a 1980 Honda Civic car!</p>
<p>So, I did two things: I started looking at smaller bikes (250cc to 400cc instead of 650cc) and I started thinking about scooters again.</p>
<p>Though Bajaj is gone, there are still wonderful scooters available. Vespa is still in the biz, making classically-styled modern scooters. They are expensive, but they are the real thing. Piaggio, Vespa&rsquo;s parent company, has its own line of scooters &ndash; a bit more modern in styling than Vespas, and quite a bit cheaper too. My understanding is that, unlike Vespas, which are made in Italy, Piaggios are assembled in Italy from parts made elsewhere, or even manufactured entirely offshore.</p>
<p>For a while I was sweet on the <a href="http://www.piaggiousa.com/scooter/fly-150.html">Piaggio Fly 150</a>:</p>

<p>After visiting a scooter showroom here in California I discovered a new (to me) scooter company: <a href="http://www.sym-global.com/">SYM</a> (<a href="http://alliancepowersports.com/">USA site</a>), a Taiwanese company that has in the past made motorcycles under contract from Honda. They have a reputation for very high quality.</p>
<p>Here is the <a href="http://alliancepowersports.com/models/HD.html">SYM HD200</a> in orange (it comes in a nice palette of colors):</p>

<p><img src="/-/SYM_HD200_orange_rear.jpg" alt="SYM HD200 rear" title="SYM HD200 rear" /></p>
<p>It costs about $3500 (US), goes 75 mph, and gets great gas mileage (70+ MPG). If you Google this scooter, everyone seems to love it. It sounds like a fun commuter or get-out-of-town ride!</p>
