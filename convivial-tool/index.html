<p>In his landmark 1973 book <a href="/tools-for-conviviality/"><em>Tools for conviviality</em></a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_Illich">Ivan Illich</a> mounted a compelling critique of industrial society. He claimed that we cannot have a society of authentic human relations unless the tools for production of the artifacts needed by that society are <em>under the control of the people using them</em>. Here is a quote to whet your appetite:</p>
<blockquote><p>I choose the term &ldquo;conviviality&rdquo; to designate the opposite of industrial productivity. I intend it to mean autonomous and creative intercourse among persons, and the intercourse of persons with their environment; and this in contrast with the conditioned response of persons to the demands made upon them by others, and by a man-made environment. I consider conviviality to be individual freedom realized in personal interdependence and, as such, an intrinsic ethical value. I believe that, in any society, as conviviality is reduced below a certain level, no amount of industrial productivity can effectively satisfy the needs it creates among society&rsquo;s members.</p></blockquote>
<p>This fits nicely with the &ldquo;mission&rdquo; of Nimble Machines: <em>liberation</em>. Not necessarily, or simply, liberation <em>from</em> technology, but perhaps liberation through <em>convivial</em> technology. As much as I might like to be, I am not a Luddite; technology fascinates me. But I cannot stomach technologies whose production <em>or consumption</em> is inimical to personal freedom, expression, and relatedness.</p>

<p>The book talks about &ldquo;conviviality&rdquo; but also convivial <em>tools</em>. What does this mean? What makes a tool convivial (or not)?</p>
<p>A convivial tool can be bent entirely to your will, made your own, used creatively, and mastered.</p>
<p>A pen, pencil, or brush is convivial; a word processing program, less so.</p>
<p>A handsaw &ndash; or a bandsaw! &ndash; is convivial; an assembly line is not.</p>
<p>Anything you might describe as a <strong>black box</strong> is by its nature <em>not</em> convivial.</p>
<p>In the world of computing, a microcontroller is convivial; a desktop computer is <em>not</em> &ndash; it has too many secret and undocumented corners, and its complexity is too much for one person to come to grips with.</p>
<p>Software can be convivial, but size is important. A too-large system that exceeds the grasp of one person I would not consider convivial, but small systems that are well-documented and <em>intended</em> to be extended by their users &ndash; Lua, Tcl, and Forth are good examples &ndash; <em>are</em> convivial.</p>
<p>Convivial tools tend to <em>require</em> effort and study. They are not &ldquo;easy&rdquo; or &ldquo;simple&rdquo;. But their mastery pays dividends, and confers a kind of freedom.</p>

<p>Illich&rsquo;s book is dense but <a href="/tools-for-conviviality/">well worth reading</a>. It forever changed how I think about technology!</p>
<p>After reading it I went apostate &ndash; technologically speaking. I read lots of books, most of them written in 1973 (seriously!). Everything I read pointed to the real and sensous world: to food (ie, organic, grown from heirloom seed), to craft, to livable (walking) cities, to human scale. I rode my bicycle everywhere. I felt that technology was the enemy of everything I found myself caring about.</p>
<p>This is true for me today. &ldquo;Technology&rdquo; is eating the world, and continues to ruin many of the things I care about.</p>
<p>But convivial tools offer a way forward to a more humane, human-scale world.</p>
