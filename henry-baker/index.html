<p>When I was tripping over lambda &ndash; I was trying to figure out why programming in Forth was so much more fun than programming in C, but ended up discovering lambda calculus instead &ndash; I read a bunch of articles by someone named Henry G. Baker.</p>
<p>He wasn&rsquo;t an academic, but he published papers in academic journals &ndash; like the <a href="http://acm.org/">ACM</a>&rsquo;s <em>Lisp Pointers</em> and <em>Sigplan Notices</em> &ndash; yet his &ldquo;organisational affiliation&rdquo; didn&rsquo;t mention an educational institution; instead, it mentioned Nimble Computer Corporation. I&rsquo;m not sure what this was, but the name inspired me. <a href="/">Nimble Machines</a> is my version of that idea.</p>
<p>He has written some seminal <a href="http://home.pipeline.com/~hbaker1/">papers</a>, esp about garbage collection.</p>
