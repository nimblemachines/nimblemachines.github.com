<p><a href="http://www.freescale.com/">Freescale</a> are now selling very cheap development/experimenter boards to showcase their new <a href="http://www.freescale.com/webapp/sps/site/homepage.jsp?code=KINETIS">Kinetis</a> series of ARM Cortex-M microcontrollers.</p>
<p>The first Freedom board &ndash; the <a href="/frdm-kl25z/">FRDM-KL25Z</a> &ndash; which Freescale initially called simply &ldquo;the Freedom board&rdquo; &ndash; was based on a Kinetis L Cortex M0+ USB part. It has since been joined by several siblings; most are based on Kinetis L parts, but some &ndash; eg the FRDM-K64F &ndash; are based on Kinetis K Cortex-M4 parts.</p>
<p>Because there is now more than one Freedom board, I thought I would make this page a list of links to (some of) the boards in the series. Ignoring the very low-end Kinetis L boards, here are three of potential interest:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/frdm-kl25z/">FRDM-KL25Z</a> &ndash; Kinetis L, Cortex-M0+, USB OTG</li>
<li><a href="/frdm-kl46z/">FRDM-KL46Z</a> &ndash; Kinetis L, Cortex-M0+, USB OTG and LCD</li>
<li>FRDM-K64F &ndash; Kinetis K, Cortex-M4, USB OTG, Ethernet</li>
</ul>
<p>The first two cost in the ballpark of USD15.00; the last is about USD35.00.</p>
<p>All of these boards have Freescale&rsquo;s broken-as-designed OpenSDA firmware, a supposedly &ldquo;open&rdquo; debug architecture that is undocumented &ndash; they promised there would be a programming manual for it, but it never arrived &ndash; and the binary <code>.sda</code> blobs that Freescale provide are encrypted!! So much for open.</p>
<p>The good news is that Freescale provide, as a binary/hex blob (an S19 file), <a href="/cmsis-dap/">CMSIS-DAP</a> support for all of these boards. This means that you can liberate them from their OpenSDA dainbramage and either use <a href="https://muforth.nimblemachines.com/">muforth</a> or <a href="http://openocd.org/">openocd</a> (as of 0.8.0) to talk to and debug the boards. I have instructions for installing CMSIS-DAP for each variant of the Freedom board on its own page; check those out.</p>
<p>The gang at <a href="http://developer.mbed.org/">mbed</a> are also working on <a href="http://developer.mbed.org/platforms/">support for Freedom boards</a>. The <a href="http://developer.mbed.org/platforms/KL25Z/">FRDM-KL25Z</a>, <a href="http://developer.mbed.org/platforms/FRDM-KL46Z/">FRDM-KL46Z</a>, and <a href="http://developer.mbed.org/platforms/FRDM-K64F/">FRDM-K64F</a> are all supported; I&rsquo;m not sure about the others in the Freedom board family.</p>
