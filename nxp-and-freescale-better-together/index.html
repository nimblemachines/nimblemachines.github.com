<p>I think I might be psychic.</p>
<p>Yesterday, while I was editing a few of the pages on this site about Freescale's series of Freedom boards, and looking for info about Freescale&rsquo;s history and management, I received an email from them about their proposed merger with NXP, which I didn&rsquo;t see until today.</p>
<p>I had found an interesting Bloomberg piece &ndash; <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/stories/2008-04-02/when-a-buyout-goes-bad">&ldquo;When a buyout goes bad&rdquo;</a> &ndash; that really got me thinking. Maybe Freescale was lucky to still be in business! How could it be that one of the companies that was a core innovator in the early days of microprocessors could have such a tenuous future?</p>
<p>I was also surprised about the current management. Many of them had joined the company within the last five years; some even more recently. And we&rsquo;re talking about the top management here. Could the company&rsquo;s culture survive?</p>
<p>While I was, for the first time, pondering the future of the company, they emailed me the bizarre, almost shocking, news: Freescale and NXP... Merging?</p>
<p>It would make more sense for Freescale to merge with TI. They are both Texas companies; it&rsquo;s hard to imagine &ldquo;efficiencies of scale&rdquo; between NXP &ndash; in the Netherlands &ndash; and Freescale, in Texas. TI&rsquo;s ARM processor portfolio really does complement Freescale&rsquo;s: TI needs to drop their buggy Tiva (n&eacute; Stellaris) parts, which they obtained thru the purchase of Luminary Micro, and Freescale&rsquo;s Kinetis would be a perfect slot-in. Also TI&rsquo;s OMAP and Freescale&rsquo;s i.MX parts &ndash; both ARM-based &ldquo;application&rdquo; processors &ndash; could possibly share engineering efforts, if the two were combined.</p>
<p>And the email seems misleading, at best. Here is a particularly juicy bit:</p>
<blockquote><p>The two companies&rsquo; portfolios overlap primarily in only one area, RF power products. In this case, NXP has decided to sell their RF power portfolio and keep the industry-leading Freescale RF portfolio. All other product families are expected to complement each other very nicely. For instance, the Freescale Kinetis MCU combination with NXP&rsquo;s leadership in connectivity and security is an easy and obvious fit.</p></blockquote>
<p>This totally overlooks the fact that Freescale&rsquo;s <a href="/freescale-s08/">HC08 and S08</a> 8-bit mixed-signal processor families are direct competitors of NXP&rsquo;s 8051-based LPC processors, and that Freescale&rsquo;s ARM-based Kinetis processors &ndash; a family they have grown aggressively in the last few years &ndash; are direct competitors to NXP&rsquo;s ARM portfolio, which they started when they were still a part of Philips!</p>
<p>Claiming no overlap in their microcontroller portfolios &ndash; the only part of both companies&rsquo; offerings that I am pretty familiar with &ndash; seems more than a bit disingenuous. Are we calming investors here? What are the engineering customers of both companies to think of this?</p>
<p>Claiming &ldquo;little overlap&rdquo; of product lines seems much truer of TI and Freescale, than of NXP and Freescale.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a huge fan of Freescale. I went thru a long process of elimination a few years back to find an 8-bit microprocessor family I could really get behind. After flirting with Atmel&rsquo;s AVR and Microchip&rsquo;s PIC, and shuddering at the idea of trying NXP&rsquo;s 8051-based chips, I settled on Freescale&rsquo;s <a href="/freescale-s08/">S08</a> series, and totally fell in love. These are great chips! And totally unloved in the hobbyist and experimentor world. I wanted to do my part to make them usable and fun, and put a ton of work (still sadly unfinished) into my <a href="https://muforth.nimblemachines.com/">muforth</a> project to support them.</p>
<p>Now I wonder what their future really is.</p>
<p>Freescale is being merged into NXP. This isn&rsquo;t two companies joining forces and becoming a new, third company. This is Freescale being absorbed. I can&rsquo;t see this as anything but a failure of sorts. The upbeat emails and press releases, putting a bright face on rather dire &ndash; even sad &ndash; news, make it rather surreal.</p>
<p>We really do live in Extremistan.</p>
