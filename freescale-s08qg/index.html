<p>The <a href="http://www.freescale.com/webapp/sps/site/prod_summary.jsp?code=S08QG">S08QG</a> is an <a href="/freescale-hcs08/">S08</a> 8-bit microcontroller subfamily.</p>
<p>I was initially interested in using one, way back in 2006, for my <a href="/spoken-word/">Spoken Word</a> project. (I never built that, but I&rsquo;d still like to.)</p>
<p>The chips have some curious errata; the most serious one involves the internal clock source (ICS), and prevents it from running full-bore (at 10 MHz). Freescale suggest running the chip at 5 MHz instead, which is perhaps fine for that application, but in general is a bit disappointing. The DIP packaged <a href="/freescale-s08qe/">QE4 and QE8</a> are probably better choices. They are a tiny bit more expensive than their QG cousins, but also have more features; in particular, they have more timer channels.</p>
<p>A few features:</p>
<ul>
<li>1.8v to 3.6v operation</li>
<li>Trimmable internal clock source, accurate enough for UART use without a crystal</li>
<li>10 MHz max bus clock</li>
<li>4 KiB or 8 KiB of flash memory, 256 or 512 bytes RAM</li>
<li>8 and 16 pin packages (DIP, SOIC, and TSSOP)</li>
<li>SCI, SPI, and I2C interfaces</li>
<li>16-bit timer with capture, compare, and PWM</li>
</ul>
