<p>Hey everyone! Happy 2021!</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s raise a glass and wish for a happy and productive 2021.</p>
<hr />
<p>Recently I discovered both an <a href="https://longan.sipeed.com/en/">interesting and very inexpensive RISC-V development board</a> and a new-to-me <a href="https://www.gigadevice.com/products/microcontrollers/gd32/risc-v/">family of RISC-V microcontrollers</a>.</p>
<p>The board is the <a href="https://longan.sipeed.com/en/">Sipeed Longan Nano</a>, available from <a href="https://www.seeedstudio.com/Sipeed-Longan-Nano-RISC-V-GD32VF103CBT6-DEV-Board-p-4725.html">seeed studio</a> and from some American distributors. (I bought a few from <a href="https://www.mouser.com/new/seeed-studio/seeed-studio-sipeed-longan-nano/">Mouser</a>.) It is based on a <a href="https://www.gigadevice.com/products/microcontrollers/gd32/risc-v/">GigaDevice GD32VF103CBT6</a> RISC-V microcontroller, costs about $5, and has a small 160x80 pixel LCD display in addition to the microcontroller.</p>
<p>GigaDevice started as a NOR flash company, and later entered the microcontroller market by making <a href="https://www.gigadevice.com/products/microcontrollers/gd32/arm-cortex-m3/">clones of ST Micro&rsquo;s STM32 chips</a> &ndash; the GD32 family.</p>
<p>In August 2019 GigaDevice <a href="https://www.gigadevice.com/press-release/gigadevice-unveils-the-gd32v-series-with-risc-v-core-in-a-brand-new-32bit-general-purpose-microcontroller/">unveiled the GD32VF RISC-V family</a>, which replaces the Cortex-M ARM core in their GD32 devices with a 32-bit RISC-V core.</p>
<p>The GD32VF103CBT6 microcontroller on the Sipeed Longan Nano board sports a <a href="https://www.nucleisys.com/index.php">Nuclei</a> <a href="https://github.com/nucleisys/Bumblebee_Core_Doc">&ldquo;Bumblebee&rdquo;</a> RV32IMAC RISC-V core running at 108 MHz, 128KiB of flash, 32KiB of RAM, and various peripherals, including full-speed USB and CAN interfaces.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Nuclei have also published an open-source RISC-V core called <a href="https://github.com/nucleisys/e200_opensource">Hummingbird</a>. There is a book to go with it, but based on the covers shown in the project&rsquo;s README it is unclear whether it has been published in English.</p>
<p>Both families of GigaDevice microcontrollers use ST Micro&rsquo;s naming conventions, encoding into the part number the microcontroller family (&ldquo;Baseline&rdquo;, &ldquo;Mainstream&rdquo;, &ldquo;Performance&rdquo;, etc), flash size, package, and pin count. It is my understanding that they are pin-compatible with the ST Micro chips.</p>
<p>The Sipeed Longan Nano is not the only <a href="https://www.seeedstudio.com/catalogsearch/result/?q=RISC-V">RISC-V board available from seeed studio</a>. Other interesting options are the <a href="https://www.seeedstudio.com/Wio-Lite-RISC-V-GD32VF103-p-4293.html">Wio Lite RISC-V</a> (which includes an ESP8266 wifi module) and the <a href="https://www.seeedstudio.com/SeeedStudio-GD32-RISC-V-Dev-Board-p-4302.html">SeeedStudio GD32 RISC-V Dev Board</a>. Both are very affordable &ndash; less than $10.</p>
<p>These are all interesting alternatives to <a href="https://www.sifive.com/">SiFive</a>&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.sifive.com/boards/hifive1-rev-b">HiFive1 Rev B</a>. The HiFive1 costs $59, has much more flash (4MiB) and runs much faster (320MHz), but it lacks many of the useful peripherals on the GigaDevice chip, such as A/D converters and USB and CAN interfaces.</p>
