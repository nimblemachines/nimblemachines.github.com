<p>Another year of little writing. It&rsquo;s too bad. I&rsquo;ve been going down lots of interesting rabbit-holes and meaning to write about <em>all</em> of them, but instead of writing I move on to the next one.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m here right now to announce that I&rsquo;m writing this entry on an <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/acer-14-chromebook-intel-celeron-4gb-memory-32gb-emmc-flash-memory-sparkly-silver/5203000.p?skuId=5203000">Acer Chromebook 14 (model CB3-431)</a>, on which I&rsquo;ve installed <a href="https://gentoo.org/">Gentoo Linux</a> in a chroot to use as a coding and writing environment. So far it&rsquo;s gone swimmingly. Gentoo seems pretty solid! The initial &ldquo;install&rdquo; (I started with a <a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Handbook:AMD64/Installation/Stage">stage3 tarball</a>) is a bit tedious, but now that it&rsquo;s done I&rsquo;ve got 19,000 software packages at my disposal!</p>
<p>This finally feels like a developer machine. I&rsquo;ve really been missing having a true <a href="/in-the-beginning-was-the-command-line/">command-line</a>!</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also quite surprising that even though the processor in this Chromebook &ndash; a <a href="https://ark.intel.com/products/91831/Intel-Celeron-Processor-N3160-2M-Cache-up-to-2_24-GHz">Celeron N3160</a> &ndash; isn&rsquo;t that beefy, building Vim, Git, and Mercurial (and a handful of dependencies) from source took only a few minutes.</p>
<p><a href="https://muforth.nimblemachines.com/">muforth</a> runs fine on this machine too. ;-)</p>

<h4 id="welcome-to-2017"><a href="#welcome-to-2017">Welcome to 2017!</a></h4>
<p>Oh, the insanity.</p>
<p>As I <a href="http://muforth.nimblemachines.com/2017/#welcome-to-2017">mentioned elsewhere</a>, I&rsquo;m not ready to say &ldquo;happy 2017&rdquo; &ndash; and I may never be. But I&rsquo;m also not ready to pivot this &ldquo;platform&rdquo; &ndash; which is where I like to chat to myself and my occasional reader about technology, computing, two-wheeled transport, and other things that catch my attention (like the occasional <a href="/restaurant-range/">restaurant range</a>) &ndash; over to politics. I <em>did</em> ponder starting another site/blog to engage in political discourse and may still, even though I&rsquo;m overwhelmed just keeping this and the <a href="https://muforth.nimblemachines.com/">muforth</a> project site alive.</p>
<p>Anyway, I&rsquo;m here to report that I&rsquo;m still here.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m about to launch into an update to this site similar to the one just undertaken on the <a href="https://muforth.nimblemachines.com/">muforth</a> site. The difference in readability is .. <em>huge</em>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also finally removed the crazy Javascript redirection from <code>www.nimblemachines.com</code> to the current year&rsquo;s journal page. I think it was messing up Google&rsquo;s indexing of the site, and I was never totally convinced that it was the right thing to do. Now the site has a normal index page, with its own content (a thoroughly goofy &ldquo;introduction&rdquo; to what Nimble Machines is all about).</p>
<p>Stay tuned.</p>
