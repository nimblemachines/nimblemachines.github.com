<h1>Falling in love with Forth</h1>

<div id="content">
<p>I have known about Forth since I was sixteen. A family friend gave me a copy of fig-FORTH for the 8080. After puzzling over it off and on for several years, I decided to finally try understand it fully. I think it was 1990.</p>
<p>I lived in Seattle at the time. I had recently quit my job at Microsoft &ndash; where, curiously, I had worked side-by-side with a fellow Forth enthusiast, modifying a bytecode interpreter and OS &ldquo;loader&rdquo; written in 68000 assembler.</p>
<p>The engineering library at the University of Washington was an amazing resource for learning Forth. They had a lot of Forth-related holdings: the Caltech manual; the FORML (Forth modification lab) proceedings; <em>Forth Dimensions</em> (the now-defunct Forth Interest Group&rsquo;s now-defunct magazine).</p>
<p>I spent a week or so reading everything and taking notes.</p>
<p>Shortly thereafter, I ran into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trimpin">Trimpin</a>, a local Seattle artist. I had seen a performance of a work of his &ndash; <em>Circumference</em> &ndash; at Bumbershoot (a big arts festival) a year or two before. This performance involved a roomful of percussion &ndash; drums, timpani, garbage cans &ndash; all played by &ldquo;robot hands&rdquo;. Each instrument had a drumstick poised over it, attached to a solenoid, which was attached via a homemade interface to Trimpin&rsquo;s computer. Using MIDI and MIDI sequencing software (Performer) he controlled this roomful of instruments. It was breathtaking.</p>
<p>His studio was in my neighborhood, and one day I met him on the street, getting an espresso. Oh, Seattle!</p>
<p>We fell into a collaboration and I was able to realize two dreams: to use Forth, and to program the Motorola 6809, a processor I had been fascinated by since reading about it in Byte magazine in the late 1970s. I wrote a Forth development system, based on a terrible &ldquo;object-oriented&rdquo; Forth for the Macintosh. In a few days&rsquo; time I was able to write an assembler for the 6809, a Forth cross-compiler, and a simple &ldquo;chat&rdquo; protocol that allowed me to type commands on the host machine (the Mac) that were executed on the target (a small 6809-based embedded computer). All this was possible because of the simplicity and transparency of Forth.</p>
<p>I enjoyed this process tremendously. I felt empowered. Programming in Forth was ecstatic, liberating. Programming in C had never been this much fun!</p>
<p>Over the next ten years we collaborated on a series of projects. These were mostly handmade, idiosyncratic &ndash; and often musical &ndash; kinetic sculptures. Trimpin would collect modern industrial &ldquo;junk&rdquo; parts, and piece together a contraption; I would program it, always in Forth. I enjoyed aspects of this collaboration immensely. I worked in his studio &ndash; an appealing environment, much more Gepetto&rsquo;s workshop than high-tech office. I was combining technology and art. I was able to try out new (for me) ideas. I wrote a multitasker. I wrote code to generate and consume MIDI. I wrote an aleatoric music generator.</p>
<p>The largest program I wrote &ndash; which sequenced a forty-foot-tall sculpture consisting of four octaves of marimbas, xylophones, and wooden milk bottles, and composed simple musical sequences on the fly &ndash; consumed 6k of object code. (This is a permanent installation in the lobby of the Science Museum of Minnesota, in Saint Paul.)</p>
<p>Forth impressed me. It liberated and empowered me. It was a small tool &ndash; one that I could understand deeply and entirely. <em>I could make it entirely my own</em> and I have. I have written several Forths &ndash; two for the PC (one in 486 assembler, one in C), and a bunch of &ldquo;target&rdquo; Forths: 6809, embedded 8086, ARM, RISC-V, MSP430.</p>
<p>I realize, looking back, that Forth is a <em><a href="/convivial-tool/">convivial tool</a></em>. I didn&rsquo;t know that going in; I wasn&rsquo;t sure, at the time, of the source of my sense of joyful liberation; but now I am sure that that is the reason.</p>
