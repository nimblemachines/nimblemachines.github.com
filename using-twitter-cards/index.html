<p>A Twitter Card is a fancy way of displaying a URL. Instead of the text of the URL itself, Twitter displays a &ldquo;box&rdquo; containing an image, the title and description of the page the URL refers to, and the domain. The idea is to make it more appealing to follow URLs.</p>
<p>Any time a Twitter user tweets a URL, Twitter follows the URL and looks for Twitter-specific page metadata (&lt;meta&gt; tags). If it finds this card metadata, it creates a <em>card</em> in the body of the tweet instead of simply displaying the URL verbatim.</p>
<p>It behooves web publishers, if they expect their readers to be sharing links to their site via Twitter, to make the (minor) effort of generating the metadata that Twitter needs.</p>
<p>I thought it was a cool idea, and wanted to see how hard it would be to add card support to <a href="https://www.nimblemachines.com/">nimblemachines.com</a> and <a href="https://muforth.nimblemachines.com/">muforth.nimblemachines.com</a>.</p>
<p>It was pretty straighforward, but I had intermittent problems with one kind of card. I&rsquo;ll talk about that later.</p>
<h3 id="how-am-i-using-them"><a href="#how-am-i-using-them">How am I using them?</a></h3>
<p>I generate my web sites using a Lua script that consumes some page metadata (title, tags, description, and a few others) and a bunch of wiki-like markup, and from this generates an HTML page, along the way generating &lt;meta&gt; and &lt;title&gt; tags for all of the metadata.</p>
<p>In order to add support for Twitter cards, all I had to do was generate a few extra &lt;meta&gt; tags for Twitter.</p>
<p>Twitter defines several <em>card types</em>; I&rsquo;m only using two of them: <code>summary</code> and <code>summary_large_image</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li>A <code>summary</code> card has a small square image next to the title, description, and domain;</li>
<li>A <code>summary_large_image</code> card puts the title, description, and domain <em>below</em> a much larger image.</li>
</ul>
<p>My Lua generator checks for the presence of a &ldquo;description&rdquo; in the page metadata. If it finds one, it generates a card. If there is also a &ldquo;twitter:image&rdquo; in the metadata, it creates a <code>summary_large_image</code> card using the image specified; otherwise, a <code>summary</code> card. The image used for the <code>summary</code> card is a &ldquo;default&rdquo; image: a larger version of the &ldquo;favicon&rdquo; image for the site.</p>
<p>Twitter says that the image should be unique to the page, but if you don&rsquo;t include an image, the card they produce has a silly-looking icon on it (of a scroll or document). Lots of people, including me, use a default image if none is specified.</p>
<p>This will make a lot more sense once you see the &lt;meta&gt; tags that are generated. I&rsquo;m going to use two examples from my <a href="https://muforth.nimblemachines.com/">muforth</a> site.</p>
<h3 id="summary-card"><a href="#summary-card">summary card</a></h3>
<p>The HTML generated for the page <a href="https://muforth.nimblemachines.com/threaded-code/">https://muforth.nimblemachines.com/threaded-code/</a>, contains the following Twitter-specific &lt;meta&gt; tags:</p>
<pre>
  &lt;meta name="twitter:card" content="summary" /&gt;
  &lt;meta name="twitter:description" content="Threaded code is an extraordinarily simple and elegant way to
     implement language interpreters. Compared to bytecoded interpreters it is quite fast, and compilers
     for it are essentially trivial." /&gt;
  &lt;meta name="twitter:image" content="https://muforth.nimblemachines.com/-/9s08_hc595_640x640.jpg" /&gt;
  &lt;meta name="twitter:site" content="@muforth" /&gt;
  &lt;meta name="twitter:title" content="Threaded code" /&gt;
</pre>
<p><code>twitter:card</code> is the card type; <code>twitter:site</code> is the Twitter handle associated with the domain. In this case, I have registered <a href="https://twitter.com/muforth">@muforth</a> as a &ldquo;project news feed&rdquo; for <a href="https://muforth.nimblemachines.com/">muforth</a>.</p>
<p><code>twitter:description</code> and <code>twitter:title</code> contain the same information as the HTML &lt;meta name="description"&gt; and &lt;title&gt; tags.</p>
<p>Here is a tweet that embeds a <code>summary</code> card:</p>
<p><img src="/-/twitter-card-summary.png" alt="twitter-card-summary.png" title="twitter-card-summary.png" class="tweet" /></p>
<h3 id="summarylargeimage-card"><a href="#summarylargeimage-card">summary_large_image card</a></h3>
<p>The HTML generated for the page <a href="https://muforth.nimblemachines.com/getting-started-with-risc-v/">https://muforth.nimblemachines.com/getting-started-with-risc-v/</a>, contains the following Twitter-specific &lt;meta&gt; tags:</p>
<pre>
  &lt;meta name="twitter:card" content="summary_large_image" /&gt;
  &lt;meta name="twitter:description" content="Using muforth and the HiFive1 board to explore the world of RISC-V." /&gt;
  &lt;meta name="twitter:image" content="https://muforth.nimblemachines.com/-/hifive1-board.jpg" /&gt;
  &lt;meta name="twitter:site" content="@muforth" /&gt;
  &lt;meta name="twitter:title" content="Getting started with RISC-V" /&gt;
</pre>
<p>The only difference from the first example is the card type. Here we are requesting a <code>summary_large_image</code> card instead of a <code>summary</code> card (because there was a <code>twitter:image</code> called out in the page metadata).</p>
<p>Here is a tweet that embeds a <code>summary_large_image</code> card:</p>
<p><img src="/-/twitter-card-summary-large-image.png" alt="twitter-card-summary-large-image.png" title="twitter-card-summary-large-image.png" class="tweet" /></p>
<h3 id="issues-with-my-journal-blog-pages"><a href="#issues-with-my-journal-blog-pages">Issues with my journal (blog) pages</a></h3>
<p>I publish my blog in an unusual &ndash; and sometimes problematic &ndash; way. Each year is a contiguous HTML page. Entries are simply HTML headings. And while it is possible, using fragment id&rsquo;s, to link to a particular heading &ndash; thus I have a sort of &ldquo;permalink&rdquo; capability &ndash; the metadata that Twitter needs to create a card refers to the page as a whole &ndash; ie &ldquo;2021 journal&rdquo;. In order to fix this I would have to break each blog entry into its own page... Which is something that I have thought about doing.</p>
<p>But as it stands, it would be confusing for Twitter to generate cards for the journal pages, because the card would always say something like &ldquo;2021 journal: my thoughts for the year&rdquo; or something like that, and <em>not</em> say anything about the particular heading that is being shared (again, by using a fragment id).</p>
<p>Since my generator only generates the Twitter card metadata if there is a <code>description</code> field in the page metadata, I simply leave it out for the journal pages.</p>
<h3 id="an-intermittent-bug"><a href="#an-intermittent-bug">An intermittent bug?</a></h3>
<p>When I first tried this out, it seemed to work very well. Twitter supplies a handy <a href="https://cards-dev.twitter.com/validator">card validator</a> that you can use to test out your card markup. (You have to be logged in to Twitter to use it.) By pasting in a URL that (presumably) contains Twitter metadata, you can see what Twitter would generate.</p>
<p>While I never saw any problems with <code>summary_large_image</code> cards, with <code>summary</code> cards I noticed that the card very often did <em>not</em> have an image associated with it. If I tried it in the validator, it worked. And if I then refreshed the tweet, the image would show up!</p>
<p>I reread the documentation, and it said that Twitter &ldquo;prefers&rdquo; 1:1 aspect ratio images, between 150x150 and 4096x4096 for the <code>summary</code> card images. I was using non-square images when I saw the intermittent behavior. I have since created special square images for the sole purpose of having a default that might make Twitter happier. I haven&rsquo;t seen any hiccups since then!</p>
<p>My advice is this: make sure to <em>always</em> use a square image &ndash; even if you have to go to some extra trouble to generate it &ndash; for <code>summary</code> cards.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion"><a href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a></h3>
<p>I think Twitter cards are a neat idea, and I had fun making them work.</p>
<p>Facebook does a very similar thing &ndash; they call it &ldquo;Open Graph&rdquo; and the metadata key names start with &ldquo;og:&rdquo; &ndash; but because I hate Facebook I decided not to bother also generating meta tags for them!</p>
