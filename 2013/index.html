<p>I&rsquo;ve added short introductions to Freescale's <a href="/freescale-s08/">HC08</a> and <a href="/freescale-s08/">S08</a> 8-bit microcontroller families. The links don&rsquo;t all work, but the basics are there.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been working on supporting the <a href="/freescale-s08/">S08</a> (in <a href="https://muforth.nimblemachines.com/">muforth</a>) since late 2008, and I still <em>really</em> like these chips. I think they are a lot of fun. I&rsquo;ve been meaning to get an overview online for some time. ;-)</p>
<p>So here it is.</p>

<p>My off-and-on obsession with commercial <a href="/restaurant-range/">restaurant range</a>s has returned.</p>
<p>A few years ago, when reading and thinking about house trucks and micro houses, I noticed that people seemed to favour using old, circa 1930s or 1940s four-burner apartment ranges. (We&rsquo;re talking about gas ranges here.) Given my sister&rsquo;s recent bad experience with the low quality of new small ranges &ndash; she installed one in a mother-in-law apartment and the top rusted completely through in a few years &ndash; I started thinking about what one could buy <em>new</em> that wouldn&rsquo;t fall apart in short order, and thereby lit on the idea of using a small (24&rdquo; wide) restaurant range.</p>
<p>These are still, in their way, behemoths: they weigh hundreds of pounds and produce tons of heat, carbon dioxide (and monoxide), and water vapour, and would need good ventilation &ndash; thus probably way overkill for a house truck or micro house &ndash; but the obsession was born.</p>
<p>And after using a friend&rsquo;s Montague Grizzly (sadly, no longer manufactured), I was hooked.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve added a page with a short list of cheap <a href="/arm-cortex-m-development-board/">ARM Cortex-M development board</a>s. All but the Teensy 3.0 are, or will soon be, supported by <a href="https://muforth.nimblemachines.com/">muforth</a>.</p>

<p>After piecemeal work on it over the last few months, I&rsquo;ve been intensively working for the past week or so on Cortex-M support in <a href="https://muforth.nimblemachines.com/">muforth</a>.</p>
<p>In order to try to understand the CMSIS-DAP code &ndash; in particular, how one writes an OpenSDA application &ndash; I ended up adding almost all the &ldquo;everyday&rdquo; ARMv7-M instructions to the disassembler &ndash; ALU ops, memory loads and stores, but none of the floating point or exotic SIMD instructions.</p>
<p>I finally finished the Cortex-M0 (ie, ARMv6-M) assembler, and just two days ago added basic debug support for the <a href="/stellaris-launchpad/">Stellaris Launchpad</a>, a bright red ten-dollar board with an 80MHz ARM Cortex-M4F processor on it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m working on a native Forth compiler that initially will target the Cortex-M0, but that means it will run fine (just slower than ideal) on Cortex-M3 and -M4 parts. (I can always tweak and improve it later to support the M3 and M4.)</p>
<p>The <a href="/cmsis-dap/">CMSIS-DAP</a> support &ndash; for the <a href="/freescale-freedom-board/">Freescale Freedom board</a> &ndash; is working fine, but seems a bit <em>slow</em>. I think doing debug over HID packets is a mistake; using bulk endpoints, or even doing control transfers (like I do for the S08JS16) seems much faster. Since I have access to the CMSIS-DAP source code, I know that they have up to 32 packets in a ring. In an effort to get things to go faster, I changed my code to have up to 16 packets &ldquo;in the air&rdquo; at a time; sadly, a large transfer (reading 128KiB of flash) went only two times faster.</p>
<p>Fundamentally I don&rsquo;t care about the performance of CMSIS-DAP &ndash; or any of these built-in debug protocols. I plan to use them only to explore the board and chip, and to get <em>my</em> debug stub code onto the chip. Once I&rsquo;ve done that I can ignore their firmware entirely. Of course this means mastering the curiousities of (currently) three ways to program the flash and talk to the USB. One reason I&rsquo;m working on getting my Forth meta-compiler working is that I&rsquo;d ideally like to write my USB debug stub in Forth. The stub &ndash; and all other little USB &ldquo;apps&rdquo; &ndash; I&rsquo;ve written for the S08JS16 is assembler (all 512 bytes of it. ;-)</p>
<p>All in all, I&rsquo;m pretty happy with my progress. Once the Forth (meta)compiler is done, I can start thinking about adding ARMv7-M instructions to the assembler.</p>

<p>After a few recent breakthroughs, I&rsquo;m now able to connect to the <a href="/cmsis-dap/">CMSIS-DAP</a> firmware on my <a href="/freescale-freedom-board/">Freescale Freedom board</a> and successfully read and write core registers and memory &ndash; using <a href="https://muforth.nimblemachines.com/">muforth</a>!</p>
<p>Two days ago, after modifying the OSX USB support in muforth (to support USB HIDs), I was able to turn the &ldquo;connect&rdquo; LED on the board on and off. This meant that the connection between muforth and the HID firmware was working.</p>
<p>Then, yesterday afternoon I successfully read the IDCODE from the on-chip SW-DP. This required getting the connection sequence right &ndash; sending a binary string to the SW-DP. ARM&rsquo;s documentation &ndash; the <a href="http://infocenter.arm.com/help/topic/com.arm.doc.ihi0031a/">ARM Debug Interface v5 spec</a> and the <a href="http://infocenter.arm.com/help/topic/com.arm.doc.prdc008772b/">ADI v5.1 supplement</a> &ndash; disagreed on what this sequence should be. I settled on sending 56 ones followed by 8 zeros, and this seemed to work.</p>
<p>My next hurdle was to try to read the chip&rsquo;s memory. But any access to AP (access port) registers failed, returning a FAULT. It turns out that it is necessary to first turn on the CSYSPWRUPREQ and CSYSDBGREQ bits in the DP.CTRLSTAT register... Once I did this, the chip was mine!</p>
<p>Very cool.</p>

<p>A new start?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m putting this crufty old site online again, but in an entirely new way: it&rsquo;s now <em>statically generated</em> &ndash; using <a href="http://lua.org/">Lua</a>! &ndash; and then pushed to <a href="http://github.com/">GitHub</a>, to be served by their (free!) <a href="http://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> service.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure how much time I&rsquo;m going to spend in the near future grooming this site, since my next project is to tackle some form of blog for <a href="https://muforth.nimblemachines.com/">muforth</a>, but I&rsquo;m happy to have it online again.</p>
