<p>When I was fifteen or so, I fell in love with a then-new Honda motorcycle: the XL250 (it is no longer made). At the time it was full of innovative technology: a big 23in front wheel, engine counterbalancers to reduce vibration (this is a one-cylinder engine &ndash; a &ldquo;thumper&rdquo; &ndash; after all), etc. Cycle World loved it. So did I. I used to lie on our blue bean-bag chair listening to Deep Purple&rsquo;s album <em>Machine Head</em> and fantasizing about zipping around on my big red bike. Going anywhere I wanted.</p>
<p>My brother was the one who realized the motorcycle fantasy. He got a blue Honda CB360 twin, then a green Honda CB550K (four-cylinder), then a full-dress 60s Harley, then a newer red Harley FXSB (in 1985). He is now sort of motorcycle-free: his &ldquo;dresser&rdquo; is in pieces, in boxes in his garage.</p>
<p>Maybe now it&rsquo;s my turn. I&rsquo;m looking at the <a href="http://kawasaki.com/html/motorcycles/mc_frame.asp">Kawasaki</a> <a href="http://kawasaki.com/html/motorcycles/dual/klr650_menu.asp">KLR650</a>. (I would link directly to the page, but because of their lame use of frames, I cannot. I linked to the sidebar menu.) Some pics:</p>

<p><img src="/-/2005_klr650_1078_800.jpg" alt="KLR650 right side" title="KLR650 right side" /></p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll go anywhere and do almost anything. People have ridden these things across continents &ndash; including <a href="http://dreamers1.com/russia/Practicalities/Russian_Trip_Report.htm">riding &ldquo;the Road&rdquo;</a> &ndash; a 2200km length of road-in-process in Russia that has been known to destroy vehicles that attempt it.</p>
<p>Suzuki make a similar bike, but it lacks the water-cooled engine, rear rack, and large fuel tank of the KLR. Suzuki&rsquo;s DR650 looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="/-/2005_DR650.jpg" alt="Suzuki DR650 blue" title="Suzuki DR650 blue" /></p>
<p>Cool looking bikes, no?</p>
<p>The KLR650 is also a thumper. There are BMW twins and a Suzuki twin (the DL650 V-strom), and in Europe the Kawasaki KLE500 (a DP version of the venerable EX500 &ldquo;Ninja&rdquo;), that claim to be DP bikes, but all the really go-anywhere, true dual-purpose bikes are thumpers.</p>
<p>The KLR650 is just a bigger and badder version of the KLR250. Its gas tank is about twenty times bigger than the 250&rsquo;s, so you can actually go places. It&rsquo;s faster on the freeway (and therefore safer), and it&rsquo;s not <em>that</em> much heavier than the 250. Trust me, I checked. Remember: it was a Honda <em>250</em> that I was drooling over in my youth. ;-)</p>
<p>Check out the <a href="http://www.advrider.com/">Adventure Rider</a> discussion site. It&rsquo;s heavily focussed on the BMWs (650/1150/1200GS), but they have an active <a href="http://www.advrider.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=15">thumpers</a> forum as well. And, to clarify, the BMW 650GS is itself a thumper. ;-)</p>
<p>There is a <a href="http://www.bigcee.com/klr650faq.html">KLR650 FAQ</a>, and a <a href="http://klr650.net/">KLR650 discussion site</a>. And to add even <em>more</em> excitement to the world of thumpers, there is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermoto">supermotard</a>, aka supermoto, craze. Check this out:</p>

<p>Two examples of the &ldquo;supermotard&rdquo; &ndash; basically a dirt racing bike with street tires on smaller (street-sized) wheels. Apparently hella fun: light, nimble, drive over curbs, etc. Urban assault vehicles. Of course, the KTM directly above is <em>not</em> street legal, lacking lights and mirrors. Apparently you can turn a KLR into a nice motard...</p>

<p>Just for fun I thought I&rsquo;d put a <a href="http://flickr.com/">flickr</a> badge on this page.</p>
