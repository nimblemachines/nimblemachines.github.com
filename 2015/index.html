<p>After more than three years of perseveration and hand-wringing I have decided to keep <a href="https://muforth.nimblemachines.com/">muforth</a> under a BSD license, and have therefore duly pushed to <a href="https://github.com/nimblemachines/muforth">Github</a> all the commits that I had kept private.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/nimblemachines/muforth">Check it out.</a></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lot of stuff:</p>
<ul>
<li>a pretty complete meta-compiled ITC Forth for the TI MSP430</li>
<li>lots of AVR goodies: assembler and disassembler; Flash programming support; incomplete Forth meta-compiler</li>
<li>beginnings of PIC18 support: assembler and disassembler; rudimentary Flash programming support for a few variants</li>
<li>lots of Cortex-M support: complete assembler and disassembler for ARMv6-M; disassembler for a subset of ARMv7-M; debug connections to ST-LINKv2, TI&rsquo;s ICDI, and Freescale/ARM&rsquo;s <a href="/cmsis-dap/">CMSIS-DAP</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Sadly, there is still very little documentation.</p>

<p>Yesterday, just as I was pondering the future of the company, I got an email from Freescale about a proposed merger with NXP. I had no choice but to wonder: <a href="/nxp-and-freescale-better-together/">NXP and Freescale: Better together?</a></p>

<p>I just wrote a short piece about <a href="/why-im-not-using-disqus/">why I&rsquo;m not using Disqus</a> on this site. I basically decided that the privacy issues were too big to ignore.</p>

<p>Happy 2015! (rather belated)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve decided to make a few changes here. I&rsquo;m working on changing the way the site is generated so that less long-form text ends up on the &ldquo;journal&rdquo; pages &ndash; where it is difficult to link to &ndash; and instead mostly lives on &ldquo;subject&rdquo; pages, which are easy to link to.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also now generating &ldquo;canonical URL&rdquo; link rel elements so that pages that are symlinked to become the canonical URL. This, together with the change that the top-level <code>index.html</code> file symlinks to <code>&lt;year>-journal/index.html</code>, means that if people make links into the top-level page, next year those links will still work.</p>
<p>As always, I bemoan the fact that I haven&rsquo;t been writing here as much as I would like. This site somehow remains a clunky mess, no matter how much thought, time, and energy I put into improving it. I guess that&rsquo;s one of the fundamental truths of the web.</p>
