<p>TI&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.ti.com/tool/ek-lm4f120xl">Stellaris Launchpad</a> board is another very low cost ARM Cortex-M development board. It is based on the LM4F120 (now renamed and rebranded as the TM4C1233 &ndash; that&rsquo;s a story unto itself), a Cortex-M4F processor with 256 KiB of flash, 32 KiB of RAM, and loads of serial i/o, timers, 12 bit ADCs, etc.</p>

<p>These are very cheap &ndash; as of August 2013 they are USD10 directly from TI, as they are getting rid of these &ldquo;old&rdquo; boards in favour of the new <a href="#tiva-launchpad">Tiva Launchpad</a>.</p>
<p>These seem like nice boards. After my inital excitement about the board &ndash; good price point, nice chip (esp the timers) &ndash; I decided to ignore it when TI relaunched the parts as &ldquo;Tiva C-series&rdquo; parts, changed all of the part numbers, and apparently alienated some of their customers. (I read some <a href="http://e2e.ti.com/support/microcontrollers/tiva_arm/f/908/p/258137/919524.aspx">grumbling on the forums</a>.)</p>
<p>This is one reason I respect Freescale as a source for microcontrollers: They have a very transparent <a href="http://www.freescale.com/webapp/sps/site/overview.jsp?code=PRDCT_LONGEVITY_HM">product longevity</a> program. Most of their processors are supported for ten years after inital launch. Medical and automotive products are supported for fifteen years. It&rsquo;s unlikely they would pull a stunt like TI&rsquo;s, of launching a product line, and then a few months later completely pulling everything and starting over.</p>
<p>That snafu notwithstanding, the chips are pretty sweet, the board is small and cheap, and it&rsquo;s easy to use. After some digging online I was able to figure out that TI&rsquo;s so-called ICDI &ndash; in-circuit debug interface &ndash; is simply an implementation over USB bulk endpoints of the GNU GDB <a href="http://sourceware.org/gdb/onlinedocs/gdb/Remote-Protocol.html">remote protocol</a>! And thus is extensively documented. After reading the GDB docs, and tweaking the USB support in <a href="https://muforth.nimblemachines.com/">muforth</a>, I was able to connect and exchange packets with the board.</p>
<p>One curious discovery: the &ldquo;M&rdquo; (write memory) command doesn&rsquo;t work! Instead of doing what it is supposed to do, it does the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>writes the first byte of the destination memory address to 00</li>
<li>ignores the first nybble of data to be written, thus shifting everything by 4 bits</li>
</ul>
<p>I thought about various work-arounds, but instead gave up and used the &ldquo;X&rdquo; command instead &ndash; which does exactly the same thing but uses a slightly more efficient binary (rather than hex-in-ASCII) format for the data.</p>
<p>I was rather surprised to discover that such a fundamental part of the GDB protocol is broken on this board! It&rsquo;s a bit embarrassing.</p>

<h3 id="tiva-launchpad"><a href="#tiva-launchpad">Tiva Launchpad</a></h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.ti.com/tool/ek-tm4c123gxl">Tiva Launchpad</a> ARM Cortex-M4F development board is TI&rsquo;s replacement for its not-very-old Stellaris Launchpad.</p>
<p>The boards are almost identical. The new Tiva boards have a different chip &ndash; the <a href="http://www.ti.com/product/tm4c123gh6pm">TM4C123GH6PM</a>, which supports USB OTG mode, unlike the <a href="http://www.ti.com/product/TM4C1233H6PM">TM4C1233H6PM</a> (n&eacute; LM4F120H5QR), which supports only Device mode &ndash; but otherwise have identical specs.</p>
<p>The Tiva boards are a bit pricier, at USD13. The Stellaris Launchpad are now selling for USD10, direct from TI.</p>
