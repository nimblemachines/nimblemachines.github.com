<p>When I was fifteen or so, I fell in love with a then-new Honda motorcycle: the XL250 (it is no longer made). The bike had two significant innovations: a big 23in front wheel, and engine counterbalancers to reduce vibration (this is a one-cylinder engine &ndash; a &ldquo;thumper&rdquo; &ndash; after all). Cycle World loved it. So did I.</p>
<p>I never bought that bike. (Or any other, for that matter.)</p>
<p>If I were looking to buy a dual sport today, I would probably skip the 250 and look at a 400 or 650cc bike. A very popular choice is the <a href="https://www.kawasaki.com/motorcycle/klr-klx/on-off-road/klr-650">Kawasaki KLR650</a>. Some pics:</p>

<p><img src="/-/2005_klr650_1078_800.jpg" alt="KLR650 right side" title="KLR650 right side" /></p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll go anywhere and do almost anything. People have ridden these things across continents &ndash; including <a href="http://dreamers1.com/russia/Practicalities/Russian_Trip_Report.htm">riding &ldquo;the Road&rdquo;</a> &ndash; a 2200km length of road-in-process in Russia that has been known to destroy vehicles that attempt it.</p>
<p>Suzuki make a similar bike, but it lacks the water-cooled engine, rear rack, and large fuel tank of the KLR. <a href="http://www.suzukicycles.com/Product%20Lines/Cycles/Products/DR650SE/">Suzuki&rsquo;s DR650</a> looks like this:</p>

<p>Check out the <a href="http://www.advrider.com/">Adventure Rider</a> discussion site. While it seems to be focussed on big twin-engined adventure bikes, there is a <a href="http://www.advrider.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=15">thumpers</a> forum as well.</p>
<p>There is a <a href="http://www.bigcee.com/klr650faq.html">KLR650 FAQ</a>, and a <a href="http://klr650.net/">KLR650 discussion site</a>. And to add even <em>more</em> excitement to the world of thumpers, there is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermoto">supermoto</a> craze. Check these out:</p>

<p>A supermoto is a dirt racing bike with street tires on smaller (street-sized) wheels. Apparently hella fun: light, nimble, drive over curbs, etc. Urban assault vehicles. Of course, the KTM directly above is <em>not</em> street legal, lacking lights and mirrors.</p>
