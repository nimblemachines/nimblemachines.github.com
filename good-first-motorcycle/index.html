<div id="content">
<p>Last year (mid-2005) when I was reading some online forums about motorcycling, a lot of people were asking about what are good motorcycles to learn on.</p>
<p>There are a few features that this beast should have. It should be:</p>
<ul>
<li>inexpensive (to buy and to run, ie, <em>insure</em>);</li>
<li>well-mannered (ie, not twitchy like race-bred crotch-rockets);</li>
<li>forgiving of mistakes;</li>
<li>not too powerful</li>
</ul>
<p>The consensus was, there are basically three motorcycles that fit this profile almost perfectly, and all would be good choices for first-time riders:</p>
<ul>
<li>Suzuki GS500</li>
<li>Kawasaki EX500R (aka Ninja 500R)</li>
<li>Kawasaki KLR650 (a <a href="/dual-purpose-motorcycle/">dual purpose motorcycle</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>They all cost around 5000 USD new, 3000 USD used.</p>
<p>Here are some pix of the 2006 Kawasaki EX500R (it also comes, like the 2006 KLR, in an ugly lime green color):</p>
<p><img src="/-/2006_ex500r_2050_800.jpg" alt="Kawasaki EX500R, front right" title="Kawasaki EX500R, front right" /></p>
<p><img src="/-/2006_ex500r_2051_800.jpg" alt="Kawasaki EX500R left side" title="Kawasaki EX500R left side" /></p>
<p>It looks racier than it is. It&rsquo;s a basic, upright seating-position, small twin. It happens to have some racy-looking stripes, but they don&rsquo;t make it go any faster.</p>
